# 621. Task Scheduler
# You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.
# â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.
from collections import Counter


def leastInterval(tasks, n):
    counts = sorted(Counter(tasks).values(), reverse=True)
    max_val = counts[0]
    groups = max_val - 1
    items = groups * n
    for count in counts[1:]:
        items -= min(groups, count)
    idle_time = max(items, 0)
    return len(tasks) + idle_time

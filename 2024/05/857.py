# 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers
# Hard
# There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.
#
# We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
#
# Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
# In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.
# Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

        for i in range(len(quality)):
            pairs.append((wage[i] / quality[i], quality[i]))

        # pairs.sort(key=lambda p: p[0])
        pairs.sort()

        total_quality = 0

        for rate, q in pairs:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -q)
            total_quality += q

            if len(max_heap) > k:

# Example 1:
quality = [10, 20, 5]
wage = [70, 50, 30]
k = 2
ans = 105.00000
res = Solution().mincostToHireWorkers(quality, wage)
print("Pass" if res == ans else f"Fail {res}")
# Explanation: We pay 70 to 0th worker and 35 to 2nd worker.

# Example 2:
quality = [3, 1, 10, 10, 1]
wage = [4, 8, 2, 2, 7]
k = 3
ans = 30.66667
res = Solution().mincostToHireWorkers(quality, wage)
print("Pass" if res == ans else f"Fail {res}")
# Explanation: We pay 4 to 0th worker, 13.33333 to 2nd and 3rd workers separately.
#
# Constraints:
# n == quality.length == wage.length
# 1 <= k <= n <= 104
# 1 <= quality[i]
# wage[i] <= 104
